# Component

This is a direct port of https://github.com/stuartsierra/component for Pixie.

There are only 2 minor differences:

* systems are regular maps and can only be declared via `system-map`
* pixie's records do not allow to add/use undeclared fields, so you
  must declare your "locals" in the record definition (it's better
  like this anyway).

The rest is 100% compatible.

## Installation

With [dust](https://github.com/pixie-lang/dust), add the following to
your project.edn `:dependencies`:

```clojure
[mpenet/component "0.1.1-alpha"]
```
